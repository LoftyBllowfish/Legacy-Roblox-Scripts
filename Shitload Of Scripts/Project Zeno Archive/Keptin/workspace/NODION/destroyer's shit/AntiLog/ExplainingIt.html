Basically, You go to this link TWICE to get the API_Key link sht:

http://sb-scripts-destroyerethank.c9.io/Jeb/AntiLog/encode.php


Reason or twice is the first time it encodes it, an the second it it gets the link for you.

THEN, Copy the link it gives you. This time the link it output was:

https://sb-scripts-destroyerethank.c9.io/Jeb/AntiLog/get_script.php?api_key=ysfwnjwqxehwdkplxwcckuyjwcvaslxiooizcvxngvnvtvnkbyoosaoauikbpowywrmcrczptkylaoqeyuuoc

Every time the api_key shall be different.

Which will then decode the stuff in the file "1.txt" and echo it so it can be used.
    
CURRENTLY, The contents of the "1.txt" file are as follows:

[[

--
--
--
--
--
--
print'Starting.'
-----------------
-------------------------------------------------------------
--Everything Above This Divider You Must Keep In The Script--
-------------------------------------------------------------




print'Hello'

]]

Which, is what the link you put in will echo out which will then allow you to
run the script as well as simultaneously resetting the api_key
making it so that anyone who tries to go to it can't get to the source.
Also, If the api_key is wrong, it echo's this:

[[

error'File not found.'

]]

So they'll believe that it's a wrong link or something.
