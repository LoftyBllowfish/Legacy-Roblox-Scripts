These are the only ones I've got, the ones without a price tag is green/rare :

-9 = Golden Case // Price - 1337

105 = Green Hill Zone // Price - 25k +

106 = MLG

107 = Beta

108 = Wyvern Scale

109 = Laser Rifle

110 = Candy Cane

To find an available slot is fairly simple, if you have 1 weapon then your available slot will be 2. If you have 29 weapons, your available slot is 30.
