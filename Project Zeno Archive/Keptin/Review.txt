Hello. My name is Quinn and my ROBLOX username is peyquinn.

My favourite pastime on ROBLOX would be posting in the forums or playing games with my friends.

I would like to be a summer intern to get a better grasp at blogging, to see what you guys do for the community, and since I didn't make it last year.

I would like to shadow Billcheesy5 since he does hat reviews fairly well.

My ambiton on ROBLOX would be to get a ): skater hat or a sparkle time fedora of any color.



Example Article: Hat Review

I will be reviewing a classic hat today. The "Shower Cap"

Mesh: The mesh is pretty cool. It makes it look realistic and it makes a nice shower cap shape. It is an original!
10/10

Texture: The texture is nice. It gives it a nice look with flowers printed all over it. The colors match the tint of water. The texture makes it perfect to be used it a shower. They even made it have a shadowish look at the botttom.

10/10

General Hat: The hat in general is very realistic looking. The texture and mesh mix well to give it the feeling of a real shower cap. I see nothing wrong with it.
10/10

Overall: This hat looks cool and is a classic. Too bad it is offsale now. It's beautiful texture gives it a good look. It looks more for the ladies though since it has flowers on it.
This hat truely deserves a 10/10. It is very original. 



I would change the contests on RN to make more retexturer contests since they can be fun and allows people to get creative with their imagination.




It was an honour to write this and I hope I get to be chosen this year unlike last year.
