--[[ Place the names of the people you want to be removed in the "banned" table.
Each name should be contained in quotes, and seperated by a comma.

People's names can be partial, and they don't need to be capitalized.
This will help if there is, say... xXSomeDudeRuiningSBXx3182980. 
You could include: "SomeDude", and the person would be removed.
